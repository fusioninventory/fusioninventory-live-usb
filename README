------------
In order for inventory data to be accurate with your server configuration, you
must redefine options in file
config/includes.chroot/etc/fusioninventory/agent.cfg

Build

Following commands will configure and then build (after some time, depending on your network
connection) an ISO file automatically configured to launch
fusioninventory-agent at boot:
 $ sudo lb config
...
 $ sudo lb build
...

All build processe is logged into build.log file.


This ISO file can be copied to USB key with dd, with a /dev/sbd USB:
